        "# Counterfactual explanations\n",
        "Counterfactual explanations (CEs) are an important tool from the field of explainable artificial intelligence (XAI). \n",
        "This notebook teaches what CEs are, why they are important, and provides how they can be discovered.\n",
        "\n",
        "## To begin with: What is *XAI*?\n",
        "XAI is a subfield of AI concerned with developing methods to help us use AI systems in a fair, safe, and responsible manner.\n",
        "To do that, XAI aims at *explaining* why an AI system (typically, actually a machine learning model) behaves the way it does.\n",
        "There are two main categories of XAI methods:\n",
        "\n",
        "1 - Methods to understand why very large and complex models, like deep neural nets and large ensembles of decision trees, come to certain decisions/predictions. \n",
        "These models are typically called *black-box* models.\n",
        "\n",
        "2 - Methods to generate models that are so simple that they can be interpreted directly. Models of this type are, e.g., decision trees, rule sets, and equations found by symbolic regression.\n",
        "These models are typically called *glass-box* models.\n",
        "\n",
        "## A brief intro to CEs\n",
        "CEs belong to the first category mentioned above: methods to explain black-box models.\n",
        "Let us consider the case in which we have a model that is a classifier, i.e., our model is a function $$f : \\Omega^d → \\mathbb{C},$$\n",
        "where $\\Omega^d$ is our space of $d$ features (some of which are numerical and thus in $\\mathbb{R}$, some of which are categorical) while $\\mathbb{C}$ is the space of classes (for example for a classifier of credit risk, $\\mathbb{C} = \\{ \\textit{High risk}, \\textit{Low risk} \\}$).\n",
        "\n",
        "Say $\\mathbf{x} \\in \\Omega^d$ is a possible input for our classifier $f$.\n",
        "$\\mathbf{x}$ represents a user. For example, $\\mathbf{x}$ can be the:\n",
        "$$\\mathbf{x} = ( \\textit{ age : 22, gender : Female, savings : 5.000\\$, job : student, } \\dots ). $$\n",
        "For a given $\\mathbf{x}$, $f$ will predict a certain class $c$ (e.g., \"$\\textit{High risk}$\").\n",
        "Now, a CE aims to answer the question:\n",
        "\"What **small change** is needed to $\\mathbf{x}$ such that the new input $\\mathbf{x}^\\prime$ will cause $f$ to produce the desired class $c^\\star$? (e.g., $f(\\mathbf{x}^\\prime) = \\textit{Low risk}$).\n",
        "\n",
        "A CE is a possible answer to the question above. \n",
        "For example, an answer could be that the user needs to increase their savings ($\\textit{5.000\\$} → {8.000\\$}$) and change occupation ($ \\textit{student} \\rightarrow \\textit{part-time employed}$).\n",
        "However, a CE may also reveal that $f$ changes its prediction based on ethnicity or gender (all other features remaining the same), meaning that $f$ learned harmful biases (e.g., from historical data) that perpetuate a discrimination against minorities (unfairness).\n",
        "\n",
        "Here's a simplified depiction in a 2D feature space:\n",
        "![](https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=1eQTEExQhIgi-2sEoCcyMELfKXACTrxAW)\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "### Seeking *small* changes to $x$\n",
        "\n",
        "We seek *small* changes to $x$ to observe how $f$ behaves in the neighborhood of an input to gain information on what the decision boundary looks like in that area. \n",
        "Moreover, a very interesting property of CEs is that they prescribe a possible intervention that the user may actually want to pursue!\n",
        "Thus, we wish that the cost of intervention is small for the user. \n",
        "This means that $\\mathbf{x}^\\prime$ needs to be as close as possible to $\\mathbf{x}$, under some meaningful distance function $\\delta$ that captures the cost of intervention.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Additional reading material\n",
        "An excellent and beginner-friendly starting point is the book by Christoph Molnar: \"Inteprable ML Book\".\n",
        "Here's a direct link to his chapter on CEs (co-written by Susanne Dandl): https://christophm.github.io/interpretable-ml-book/counterfactual.html\n",
        "\n",
        "## Note: CEs vs adversarial examples\n",
        "CEs are similar to adversarial examples (AEs). In both cases, one searches for changes to the input $x$ that trigger a change to the prediction made by $f$. However, CEs are intended to explain $f$ and not to fool it!"
